# Marvel-Social-Analysis-using-Spark-Scala

Project Description: Developed a Spark (Scala) script to read Marvel Superhero social network dataset and find the most-connected superhero. Implemented breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithm within the script that can be distributed to compute the degrees of separation between any two superheroes. Additionally used Accumulators to maintain running totals that are synced across a cluster.
